# AutoFields

**⚠️ NOTE: This plugin was created for QGIS 2.x.; QGIS 3.x offers equivalent functionality out of the box. ([See how](https://github.com/gacarrillor/AutoFields/issues/5#issuecomment-386892366))**

--------------

QGIS plugin to configure automatic attribute updates when creating or modifying vector features.

Unlike Virtual Fields, AutoFields:

 - Store calculated values directly in the data source;
 - Are independent of QGIS projects, i.e., you can switch between QGIS projects and AutoFields will still work;
 - Only work on editable vector layers.
