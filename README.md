# AutoFields

QGIS plugin to configure automatic attribute updates when creating or modifying vector features.

![Automatic updates on vector fields](http://downloads.tuxfamily.org/tuxgis/tmp/akqfv3(1).gif)

Unlike Virtual Fields, AutoFields:

 - Store calculated values directly in the data source;
 - Are independent of QGIS projects, i.e., you can switch between QGIS projects and AutoFields will still work;
 - Only work on editable vector layers.
